    <div class="title-text white-text"><h1>Celeste</h1></div>

    <div class="game-text white-text">Celeste is a charming game where you take the role of a young woman named Madeline as she attempts to scale a fictionalized version of Mount Celeste in British Columbia, Canada.  Throughout her arduous journey (the platforming is incredibly difficult, but ultimately inceredibly rewarding), she makes friends, overcomes obstacles, and confronts her own inner demons.  Not only is the story great, but the platforming is the best that I have ever seen.</div>
