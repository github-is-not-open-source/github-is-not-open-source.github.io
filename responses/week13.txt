The author defines a feed as a near limitless, unending stream of content that puts us into a state of semi-boredom.  In this way, the author's talk was very similar to a feed.  As the talk flowed from one topic to the next that were only somewhat related, the author managed to touch on a wide variety of internet topics including streaming, bots, generative AI, and more.  What I got from this reading was that the new paradigms of publishing on the internet are changing the way content is shared and we must learn and adapt to this new reality by pushing back against too much of the feedification of information.

 

Questions:

1. How does generative AI command attention as the author describes in the post section of the talk (fist few slides)
