I liked this reading because it explained and illuminated the dark history of computers and also how they can be used to oppress people.  It also explains that computers have the ability to help people too.  I am interested in learning more about the claims made that the US government was responsible for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr and Malcom X's deaths.

 

Question:

1. How can you use computers in your life to improve your community?
