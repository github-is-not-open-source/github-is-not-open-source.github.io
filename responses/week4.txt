I found the way that the author discussed dead webpages to be incredibly interesting.  They describe the deletion of GeoCities as 'barbaric' and a tragedy.  To me, that feels a bit extreme.  However, I can understand the feeling.  Encountering a dead website can feel sad and upsetting.  I think towards the end of the essay, the author acknowledges that the death of websites is inevitable and part of the natural process of the internet.  Regardless, the way that the author describes personal webpages as a type of self expression makes me want to make my own!

 

Questions:

1.  Should as many websites as possible be archived with tools such as the Internet Archive's way back machine?  Does it make fiscal and technological sense to do this?  If not, which websites should be archived?

2. What can we learn by looking at webpages from the past?
