This reading was so confusing.  It made no sense to me.  I liked the part where the author was talking about whether art can truly survive in an internet that is built to surveil but the author didn't even seem to finish the discussion before moving onto a new topic!  A central point of discussion in the article seemed to be how art will evolve now that museums don't gatekeep art, however it was very difficult for me to parse what the author's argument was.

 

Question:

1. Do you think that art can survive within an ecosystem of surveillance such as the internet? Does art require secrecy?
