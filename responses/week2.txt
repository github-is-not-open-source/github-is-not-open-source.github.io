This reading was a bit confusing for me.  What I understood was that the author is claiming that the mail part of 'mail art' is not separate from the 'art' but rather an integral part.  He explains this by expanding the notion of mail art to not only include the actual artwork, but the entire experience of creating, sending, and responding to mail art.  He also describes mail art as being a type of rebellion against the 'big monster'.  In my opinion, the big monster might represent the society that we currently have that keeps people isolated, both physically and emotionally. 

 

Questions:

1. What other interpretations of the big monster?

2. Do you agree with the author that the sending and response part of mail art is truly part of the art?  Is it something separate?  How does your opinion impact the way that you see the interconnection between the art of web design and the infrastructure of the internet?
