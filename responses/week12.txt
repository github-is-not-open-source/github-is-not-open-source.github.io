This reading was quite confusing.  What I got from it was a sense of just how pioneering Vera Frankel was with String Games and Body Missing.  Body Missing was created only a year after the world wide web was launched, demonstrating that Frankel was on the forefront of innovation of creating art with new technologies.  To me, it seems like the common theme connecting the two artworks is the idea of the 'erasure' (as the author puts it of people, with String Games through the screen and in Body Missing by the discussion of the artworks (and thus people) missing due to the atrocities commited during the Holocaust).

Questions:

1. Are there any other similarities between these two pieces of art?
