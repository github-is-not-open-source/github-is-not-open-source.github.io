This reading was interesting.  The author's obsession with portable printers kind of reminded me of the "Back to the Future" prediction about fax machines being the future.  I think that that is unlikely.  However, I did appreciate the broader discussion of how physical and electronic media can work together.  I thought the mention of qr codes was interesting as it is similar to something that the laptop producer Framework does: they label each of the components in the computer with a qr code that allows you to scan it to go to a website with repair instructions.  

 

Questions:

1. Do you think personal printers are the future?

2. What benefits to the average person does print digital hybrid have over simply digital?
