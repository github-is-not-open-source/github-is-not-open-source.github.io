I thought that this was a very long winded explanation of the Gestalt principle (the whole is more than the sum of its parts).  However, I did appreciate the history relayed at the beginning.  I also liked the idea of the whole being completely different from its parts.  I think that says a lot about how our brains perceive the world.  I also loved the logo examples that were given.  They demonstrate how a few simple elements can come together to form a really recognizable brand.

 

Questions:

1. What is the relationship between the gestalt principle and simplicity?  Does the former require the latter?
