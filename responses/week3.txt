Schwulst stresses the importance of creating a website that had a positive effect on you (the creator) which will then lead to a positive effect on the internet and world as a whole.  Schwulst explains multiple ways of thinking about websites as a form of self expression or reflection that they think will make the world a better place.  The central part of each metaphor they use is the idea of a website as a way for others to interact or engage with another individual.  In this way, one can see that they are arguing that having individuals connect on the web is the best way to improve it.  Édouard has a very similar thought process.  They argue that the best way to expand one's mind and learn is by engaging in discussion and interaction with others in small group settings.  In this way, Schwulst's models for websites could prove helpful to accomplish Édouard's suggestions.

 

Questions:

1. Where do interactive websites (such as forums, chat rooms, or wikis) fit into Schwulst's metaphors?

2. How can individual websites help foster the connections that Édouard describes?
