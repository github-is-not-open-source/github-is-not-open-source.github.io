    <div class="title-text white-text"><h1>Celeste</h1></div>

    <div class="game-text white-text">Celeste is a charming game where you take the role of a woman named Madeline as she attempts to scale a fictionalized version of Mount Celeste in British Columbia, Canada.  Throughout her arduous journey (the platforming is incredibly difficult, but ultimately incredibly rewarding), she makes friends, overcomes obstacles, and confronts her own inner demons.  Not only is the story great, but the platforming is the best that I have ever seen in a video game.  As an added bonus, the soundtrack is incredible and the pixel art is gorgeous.</div>

    <div class="title-text white-text"><h1>Super Mario World</h1></div>
    <div class="game-text white-text">Super Mario World might be surprising as one of my favorite games given my age, however, this game is simply an incredible platformer.  The story isn't great (it's a Mario game after all!), but the movement is so much fun and the game is incredibly replayable (I have played it at least three separate times).  In my opinion, this is the best 2D Mario game.  There is an incredibly active modding community based around this game on sites such as <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net">smwcentral.net</a>.

    <div class="title-text white-text"><h1>Undertale</h1></div>
    <div class="game-text white-text">Undertale is an incredible story-driven game that is ultimately about the player's choices.  With it's fun cast of characters and incredible writing, it makes the player feel agency for their choices.  The music is also incredible.</div>

    <div class="title-text white-text"><h1>Breath of the Wild</h1></div>
    <div class="game-text white-text">It's hard to understate the impact that Breath of the Wild had on the gaming industry.  It singlehandedly redefined what open world games could be.  The game's focus on allowing the player freedom to explore the world at any pace or in any order that they want to allows each player to have a unique playthrough.  When I first started, I would play this game for up to seven or eight hours every day.  This addictive quality comes from the amount of creativity that the game lets the player use to do almost any taskâ€”even just traversing the world.</div>
