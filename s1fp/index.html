    <h1>Video Games</h1>
    <div id="text">I love video games.  I have been playing them for a while now and I have a number of opinions about them.  I have a number of opinions about the gaming industry and games in general, but the purpose of this site is not to be a place for my rants about how DRM is a parasite on the gaming community or how all games should offer native Linux versions.  This website is meant to catalogue some of my favorite games and serve as a list of games that I want to someday play. Look above to choose where to go!</div>
